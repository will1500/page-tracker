# Flask Web Application CI Pipeline with Docker

## Overview

Continuous Integration (CI) is crucial for modern software development, streamlining code changes and catching errors early. 
Docker containers enhance this workflow by providing a consistent environment for testing and deploying code. This tutorial 
guides you through establishing a robust CI pipeline for a Flask web application using Docker.
